# Lan_chat

LAN Chat is a server-client communication system designed to facilitate real-time chat interactions within a local area network (LAN). This project utilizes ESP32 boards as clients, allowing them to connect to any system on the network acting as a server. The application is command-line interface (CLI) based, providing a simple and efficient way for users to communicate across the network. By leveraging the capabilities of ESP32 devices, LAN Chat offers a unique blend of hardware and software integration, making it an innovative solution for local network communication.
